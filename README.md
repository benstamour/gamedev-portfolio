Benjamin St. Amour's Game Development Portfolio
==============================================

[The Dungeon](https://github.com/benstamour/dungeon-game)
=========================================================

This project is a 3D dungeon platformer game made in Unity, where the player must navigate a series of deadly obstacles in order to get to the end, with the optional additional challenge of collecting each of the ten coloured orbs placed along the player's route. The goal is to make it to the end as fast as possible! I designed and created the dungeon arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, and editing 3D models. The repository contains a link to download the build and instructions to play the game alongside the source code, and **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/dungeon/)** also features the download link with some images of the game and a list of assets I used.

[The Fortress](https://github.com/benstamour/the-fortress)
==========================================================

This is my second 3D Unity platformer, following The Dungeon; to expand on my first game, I worked with more intricate obstacles and triggers, along with a save point feature, and I experimented with different lighting types and placements. I designed and created the arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, lighting, and editing 3D models (sculpting, posing, modifying vertices, and arranging scenes). The repository contains a link to download the build and instructions to play the game alongside the source code, and **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/fortress/)** also features the download link with some images of the game and a list of assets I used.
